# Vanced (Sleep, brother)

Vanced will be remembered for their contribution to the world and the community.   
Their **Official sources** to get their Apps are available no more unless **you build yourself** one. However, there exist **Vanced** apps everywhere on the internet by means **un-official sources** and _**this is one of them**_ and hence you cannot trust the source.

**These are the SHA-256 hashes for all Vanced apks**. 
Although it is not recommend downloading Vanced from unverifiable sources so use these to make sure that you don't end up with a tampered build.
